Current and future projects
---------------------------
(In rough order of priority.) 

1. Create more unit tests for the individual group parsers in Metar.py

2. Provide a station class that knows how to interpret and handle station
   codes.  It should translate station codes to their common names and 
   provide their position (lon-lat).  It should also make it easy to 
  calculate distances between stations and to identify nearby stations.

3. Provide more sample scripts. 

4. Provide better documentation.

5. Make the metar.Datatypes classes immutable, so that objects can be reused.
   A large fraction of the time it takes to initialize a Metar object is in
   the instantiation of the metar.Datatypes objects. 

Suggestions are always welcome.
